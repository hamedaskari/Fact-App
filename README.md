# Fact App

It is created with `Reactjs` and basically it helps you to post a new fact and then people can vote on your fact.

First you should click on the `share a fact` button. Then you share your fact.

If you want to share a fact you probally have to include these:

- ✅ The content of your fact
- 🚀 A trustworthy source which starts with [http:// or https://] like http://example.com
- 🔥 And the fact's category [which you can choose from a dropdown list]

> Also remeber that there is a 200 letter limit to your fact😉

Each fact consists of 3 buttons:

- 👍 Interesting
- 🤯 Mind-blowing
- ⛔ False

> Note that if your fact's false votes are more than your interesting and mind blowing facts together your fact will be disputed.

Also there is a caterogy section which includes various categories such as:

- All
- Science
- Technology
- Finance
- Society
- Entertainment
- Health
- History
- News

🔺 The app is connected to `Supabase` and you can retrive data from the databse, update and also insert new data.
